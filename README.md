## 📁 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Dice Rolling Simulation 🎲
- Simulates rolling a dice 1000 times.
- Uses `numpy.random` for simulation.
- Displays frequency of each face using a bar chart.
- 📊 Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib

### 2️⃣ Temperature Converter 🌡️
- Converts temperature values between Celsius, Fahrenheit.
- Uses NumPy for efficient calculations.
- 📊 Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib

### 3️⃣ Traffic Speed Monitoring System 🚗
- Simulates random vehicle speeds.
- Calculates average, max, min speed.
- Visualizes data using histograms.
- 📊 Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib

### 4️⃣ Happy Face Generator 😊
- Generates a pixel-art-style happy face using a 2D NumPy array.
- Each 1 represents a pixel of the face, and 0 represents the background.
- Visualized using imshow() with a smooth colormap.
- 📊 Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib
- 📌 Concepts: 2D arrays, colormap visualization, image grids

### 5️⃣ Geometric Pattern Grid 🟩
- Creates a 10x10 geometric pattern using alternating 0s and 1s.
- Visualized using viridis colormap for a smooth gradient aesthetic.
- Great for experimenting with logic-based designs and 2D visualization.
- 📊 Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib

### 6️⃣ Heart Rate Monitoring Simulation ❤️‍🔥
- Simulates a realistic 60-minute heart rate data during an exercise session.
- Uses a sinusoidal pattern with added Gaussian noise for realism.
- Plots heart rate trend, highlights the maximum value, and shows heart zones.
- 📊 Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib
- 📌 Concepts: Data simulation, sine waves, random noise, line plots, fill_between
